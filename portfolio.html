						 As I was scrolling through Reddit, I discovered a subreddit dedicated to data visualization. 
							Exploring this subreddit made me realize that data visualization can be both aesthetic and powerful. 
							Inspired by this, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to mastering data visualization techniques. 
							I primarily use RStudio for creating my visualizations. Click on the images to expand them.

							<br><br> 
							 
							PS: There are several other notable works that I'm unable to demonstrate here. 
							<br>
							The <a href="research.html">Research Experience</a> section also includes visualized data, but on their respective pages.

							<h3>River Network of Nepal</h3>
							<p>
								Nepal is often referred to as "The second richest country in water resources." 
								While this claim might be an exaggeration, it is undeniable that Nepal possesses significant water resources. 
								Many of its rivers originate from the snow-covered mountains, while others begin in the Mid-Hill region. 
								Additionally, numerous smaller rivulets originate from the Chure region, a young lowland area of Nepal.
								Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali (from east to west) are the three major river systems of Nepal. <br>
								I downloaded the data from <a href = "https://www.hydrosheds.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HydroSHEDS</a> and developed the river network of Nepal. 
								<br> This image has received more than 28,000 post impressions in 
								<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sushank-pokhrel_nepal-datavisualization-rprogramming-activity-7219403884732047362-9LZ4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

							<h3>Suitable Habitat of <i>Bambusa nepalensis</i></h3>
							<p>Bamboo, often referred to as "green gold," holds immense value in Nepali livelihood and culture. 
								In Nepali Hindu traditions, bamboo plays a crucial role from birth to death. It is used in various rites and rituals. 
								In rural Nepal, bamboo is integral to daily life, being used to make baskets and other essential items. 
								It is also an important fodder species for livestock.
								<br>
								Additionally, bamboo is frequently planted in areas prone to landslides and floods to help prevent such disasters due to its strong root system and soil-stabilizing properties.
								<br>
								I am currently leading a research project focused on the habitat suitability modeling of
								<a href="research_description.html#bamboo_sdm">seven bamboo species</a>.

							<h3>Road Network of Kathmandu Valley</h3>
							<p>
								Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, has some of the busiest traffic in 
								the country. Navigating the roads here can be quite challenging, 
								especially if you lack prior experience driving or riding in such chaotic 
								roads. Crossing the road can be troublesome in areas without traffic lights. 
								This is mainly due to the overwhelming number of two-wheelers (motorbikes and scooters). 
								I once heard a foreigner say, "Kathmandu has motorbike terrorism." 
								The traffic in Kathmandu is heavy for two reasons: high population density and unplanned roads. 
								The city has undergone extreme urbanization, but without any prior planning. 
								Kathmandu is difficult not only because of the roads but also due to unplanned housing, 
								polluted air, and contaminated rivers.

							<h3>Physiographic Zones of Nepal</h3>
							<p>Nepal boasts one of the most unique physiographies in the world. Within a span of about 200 km,
								the altitude changes dramatically from 60 meters above sea level to 8,848 meters above sea level.
								Nepal is classified into five distinct physiographic regions: High Himalaya, High Mountain, Hill, Siwalik, and Terai/Tarai. 
								A journey from the southernmost plains of the Terai to the northern High Himalayas allows one to experience 
								extremely hot temperatures, the cool breezes of the Mid-Hills, and the snowy regions of the High Himalayasâ€”all in a single day.
								<br>
								Unfortunately, the polygon shapefile for these regions is not readily available online. 
								To address this, I have provided the GIS polygon shapefile of Nepal, which can be accessed through this 
								<a href = "https://github.com/sushank-pokhrel/physiographic_zones_of_nepal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>.

							<h3>Bird Collision</h3>
							<p>In contemporary times, bird collisions with infrastructure have become a significant concern. 
								Birds frequently collide with towers, tall buildings, poles, and high-tension power lines. 
								These collisions often result in fatalities, with more than half of the incidents proving deadly for the birds. 
								While such deaths might not substantially impact common bird species, 
								they pose a serious threat to endangered or threatened bird populations.
								<br>
								While I was working on a project related to habitat suitability modeling of Great Hornbill <i>Buceros bicornis</i>, 
								<a href = "https://www.birdlifenepal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bird Conservation Nepal</a> porvided me the data of bird collision in Nepal, 
								which I used to develop this map.
