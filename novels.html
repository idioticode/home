							It was the April of 2016 when I wrote my very first short story.
							It was about an unfulfilled love between a boy and a girl who tragically separated
							due to the Earthquake in 2015. (I still remember the day of the earthquake,
							2072 Baisakh 12.) It was a great tragedy for Nepal, but I believe this earthquake sparked
							an inherent creativity within me. <br>
							I wrote numerous short stories until I started my Bachelor's Journey. More than half of them
							are lost now. Out of all those, I only remember the very first story I wrote.
							<br> While I was in the second semester of my B.Sc. Forestry, I got my laptop, where I
							completed the first
							draft of my novel. Then came COVID-19. I went to my village, far from the urban crowd. While
							there, I completed
							the draft of my second novel, but on the old laptop I first used.
							<br>After the first wave of COVID-19 ended, I came back to Butwal, where my second home
							lies. There, I wrote the
							draft of my third Novel (not exactly a novel but a diary of a girl who has just started to
							explore herself).
							Later, I developed the digital format of this diary. Currently, I am writing a novel, which
							I started more than
							a year ago, but I am unable to continue. Only about 15% of it has been completed.
							<br>
							(FYI, I'm writing this novel in my diary instead of typing it on a computer.
							I enjoy the process of writing more than the novel or story itself.)
							<br>
							<br>
							Below is a brief description about my novels and stories.

							<h3>महान् (<i>mahān</i>)</h3>
							<p>
								A guy is frustrated by the political instability of the Government of Nepal. He dreams
								of
								changing everything by himself. He comes up with the idea of time traveling to alter the
								main
								events that occurred in the past. This is where the novel begins.
								<br><br>This novel is a blend of science fiction, history, and psychological thriller.
							</p>
							<br><br>
							<br><br>
						</div>

						<div class="single-review">
							<h3>Unnamed</h3>
							<p>A teenage boy attends a <i>kulpooja</i>, a type of ritual where <i>kuldevata</i> (deity)
								of one's own <i>kul</i> (clan) is worshipped.
								During the ceremony, he experiences a divine power.
								The boy then recites a story that took place about a century ago, vividly seeing
								everything that happened in the past, about 100 years ago,
								due to the divine power from the deity.</p>
							<br><br>
							<br><br>
						</div>

						<div class="single-review">
							<h3>पञ्जिका (<i>panjikā</i>)</h3>
							<p>This is the diary of a young teenage girl who has just begun exploring the world.
								It also chronicles the journey of a teenager.
								This diary is, in many ways, reflective of my own journey.</p>
							<br><br>
							<br><br>
						</div>

						<div class="single-review">
							<h3>Unnamed</h3>
							<p>The protagonist leads a very boring, monotonous life and is simply exhausted from living
								it.
								Due to an unexpected event, the protagonist dies in the very first chapters.
								This is where the story begins.
								<br><br>
								It has been challenging for me to continue this story, and I've written only a few
								pages.
