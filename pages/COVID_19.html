					Impacts of COVID-19 on Biodiversity Conservation in Nepal. 
				</h2>
				<p>
					<p>
                        COVID-19 had cascading impacts on every sector, including biodiversity conservation.
                         During the pandemic, there was an observed increase in poaching, illegal hunting of wildlife, 
                         illegal felling of trees, and firewood collection in many parts of Nepal. 
                         Therefore, a study was conducted to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on biodiversity in Nepal.
                        <br><br>
                        A nationwide telephone survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                        However, due to multiple factors, the study was halted. 
                        After I joined the Society for Conservation Biology-Nepal, 
                        I was tasked with performing Bayesian modeling to study the impact.
                        <br><br>
                        While performing Bayesian modeling, COVID-19 cases and active conservation activities 
                        were considered independent variables, selected after a 
                        multi-collinearity test. Factors such as tree felling, firewood collection, 
                        and incidents of forest fires were considered dependent variables. 
                        The changes in these dependent factors before and during the pandemic were utilized in the modeling.
                        <br><br>
                        After modeling, I drafted the first research manuscript. 
                        The draft is still under preparation and will soon be submitted to 
                        a high-impact factor journal.
                    </p>
