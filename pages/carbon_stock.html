					Carbon Stock Comparison of Broadleaved and Coniferous Forest.
				</h2>
				<p>
				Carbon sequestration is one of the key roles played by forests, alongside their economic benefits. Sequestering carbon is crucial for removing atmospheric CO2 and mitigating the rate of global warming.
				<br><br>
				I participated in a study comparing the carbon content in Broadleaved and Coniferous forests in a subtropical region at approximately 1,300 meters above sea level. The Broadleaved forest was dominated by Shorea robusta (Sal), while the Coniferous forest was dominated by Pinus roxburghii (Rani Salla).
				<br><br>
				We used stratified random sampling to deploy inventory points proportionately and established circular plots for field data collection. Tree height was measured using a vertex and transponder, which I used for the first time.
				<br><br>
				In addition to fieldwork, I performed data analysis and visualization. The primary objective was to test for significant differences between various parameters of the two forest types, including tree regeneration and diversity indices. We also compared tree diversity and carbon stock between the forests.
				<br><br>
				Our results revealed that the Broadleaved forest had greater tree diversity and carbon stock compared to the Coniferous forest.
